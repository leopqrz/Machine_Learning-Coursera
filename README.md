# Machine Learning - Stanford/Online (Coursera)

Completed Assignments for [Machine Learning course] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/).  This course was offered by the Stanford/Online in Coursera Platform with Dr. Andrew Ng. It's about Machine Learning. The assignments cover contents including but not limited to Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and so on.

All the assignments are done with [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/).

### Assignment 1:

- [Matlab](https://github.com/leopqrz/Machine_Learning-Coursera/tree/main/Assignments/Matlab/01%20-%20LinearRegression/ex1)|[Python](https://github.com/leopqrz/Machine_Learning-Coursera/tree/main/Assignments/Python/01%20-%20LinearRegression) **Linear Regression:** In this exercise, It was implemented a linear regression.

### Assignment 2:

- [Matlab](https://github.com/leopqrz/Machine_Learning-Coursera/tree/main/Assignments/Matlab/02%20-%20LogisticRegression/ex2)|[Python](https://github.com/leopqrz/Machine_Learning-Coursera/tree/main/Assignments/Python/02%20-%20LogisticRegression) **Logistic Regression:** In this exercise, It was implemented logistic regression applied it to two different datasets.

### Assignment 3:

- [Matlab](https://github.com/leopqrz/Machine_Learning-Coursera/tree/main/Assignments/Matlab/03%20-%20NeuralNetworks_part1/ex3)|[Python](https://github.com/leopqrz/Machine_Learning-Coursera/tree/main/Assignments/Python/03%20-%20NeuralNetworks) **Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks:** In this exercise, It was implemented one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.

### Assignment 4:

- [Matlab](https://github.com/leopqrz/Machine_Learning-Coursera/tree/main/Assignments/Matlab/04%20-%20NeuralNetworks_part2/ex4)|Python **Neural Networks Learning:** In this exercise, It was implemented the backpropagation algorithm for neural
  networks and applied it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.
